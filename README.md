# The Best FIFA Award - Some statistics
Some useful statistics and plots to show vote distribution. <br>
Focus was on vote counts and points counts (weighted vote counts)

## Vote Distribution - Per category

First vote distribution per category has been analyzed. There are countries where some category (Captain,Coach or Media) did not take part 
in the vote . I created a dataframe to make it easier to see which country-vote category is missing.

## Vote Distribution - Per Confederation
The second step was to analyze how each confederation (AFC,CONCACAF,CONMEBOL,CAF,OFC,UEFA) has voted.
